# AdFL
This is a data repository for AdFL paper. 
It contains 40 subject files, 800 synthetic adaptations, labeled tests for each adapatiaons and set of unlableled tests. 
For example:
UrlValidator_1_10.java file is a synthetic adaptation for UrlValidator.java file produced by 10% labeling scheme with corrrosponing
labeled tests. Similarly for 20% labeling scheme. 
UrlValidator.java is the original file. 
UrlVlaidator_labeled_ublabeled folder contains labeled and unlabeled tests for UrlValidator. 
We note that currently few _10 and _20 files are missing. They will be soon updated. 

Pristine folder contains pristine java projects that we used for running our tests. These java projects gets updated fast so we recommend using same projects to get exact same results. Some of them may be few years old.
